  Practice key Python skills related to:
    - imports
    - logging
    - variables
    - type hints
    - global constants
    - f-strings
    - functions
    - main function
    - conditional execution guard

OBS:
  This is your file to practice and customize.
  Find the TODO comments, and as you complete each task, remove the TODO note.

TODO: Change the Author line of the docstring above to your name or alias.

TODO: RENAME this file from app_yourname.py to something
      that includes your name or alias, e.g., app_stellar_analytics.py.

TODO: Update the opening line of the docstring above to match the new file name.

TODO: Update the associated `uv run python` command in the README.md file.

# === DECLARE IMPORTS (BRING IN FREE CODE) ===

import logging
import statistics
from typing import Final

from datafun_toolkit.logger import get_logger, log_header

# === CONFIGURE LOGGER ONCE PER MODULE (PYTHON FILE) ===

LOG: logging.Logger = get_logger("P01", level="INFO")


# === DECLARE GLOBAL CONSTANTS ===

# All these global variables are CONSTANT, they do NOT change when the program runs.
# By convention, constants are named in UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
# The following illustrates variables that hold these common types:
#    str, int, float, bool, list of strings.
# `Final` is added to indicate these variables should not be reassigned.
# Examples:

MY_ANALYTICS_COMPANY: Final[str] = "DataFun Analytics"
MY_EMPLOYEE_COUNT: Final[int] = 150

# See the other file for examples.
MY_NAME: Final[str] = "Jugurtha"

MY_AGE: Final[int] = 27

MY_GPA: Final[float] = 3.95

IS_ACTIVE: Final[bool] = True

# REQ: Strings must be in quotes and items are separated by commas,
# REQ: The list is wrapped in square brackets. (See the other file for examples.)
MY_PEERS: Final[list[str]] = ["Micheal", "Jordan", "Sarah"]

# === DECLARE A FUNCTION TO FORMAT THE INFORMATION ===
